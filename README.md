# steam friend night

This is my 4th rewrite of this app. I ditched Svelte and went back to good ol' Mithril.js for minimal, yet still ergonomic-enough dev tooling. The backend is [steam-api](https://github.com/kevinfiol/steam-api).

## Dev

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# build
pnpm build

# dev
pnpm dev
```
